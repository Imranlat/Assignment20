//20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items

// Creating a list of animals
let animals: string[] = ["lion", "elephant", "tiger", "giraffe", "zebra", "cheetah", "monkey", "rhinoceros", "hippopotamus", "crocodile"];

// Printing the list of animals
console.log("List of animals:");
animals.forEach(animal => console.log(animal));
